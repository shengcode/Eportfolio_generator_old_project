        <p>This is<br>a para<br>graph with line breaks
         <br> As an ardent fan of ready-made metaphors, as well as of cats, Swift was excited by this. <br>
         "My first reaction was, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp"> Did you take a picture?</a>
          she says. "And then I thought about it.<br> 
         Half of my brain was going, 'We should be able to take a picture if we want to. That guy is <br>
         asking for it â€“ he's got a cat on his head!' But the other half was going, 'What if he just<br>
         wants to walk around with a cat on his head, and not have his picture taken all day?'"<br></p>

        <p>As she's moved the garden west to the Getty, she's tapped a dozen contemporary<br> artists 
from across the country, including Larry Bell, Harry <br>Gesner and Richard Irwin, to make salads with her here.<br>
Sherman says the salad garden is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp"> an opportunity for artists</a> to learn about rare <br>heirloom plant varieties and engage with these plants as their materials in a new way.<br>
"Every salad is a new take, especially when the prompt is to make something <br>based off of what we're growing here," Sherman says. "We have some <br>familiar plants, but a lot of these plants people have never had before. Even <br>if artists come with a plan which we develop ahead of time, there's a certain <br>element of chance and improvisation that necessarily happens on site."
